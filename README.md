# Scraping-Dar-al-Ifta-Egypt
This code scrapes the text, dates, and titles from statements and articles from the Egyptian Dar al-Ifta's website. 


This code was used to create a webcrawler that would scrape all of the links for statements and articles from the website of Egyt's Dar al-Ifta (https://www.dar-alifta.org/AR/default.aspx?LangID=1&Home=1&sec=fatwa). The webpage is dynamic so the code would break if used on the present day site. However, so long as the structure of the page is the same, and as of Sept. 22, 2021 it is, the code would only need a few modifications to work as intended.
